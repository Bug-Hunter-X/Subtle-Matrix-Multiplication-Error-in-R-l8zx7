This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in R programming related to matrix multiplication. The `bug.R` file contains code that attempts to perform matrix multiplication using the `%*%` operator.  However, due to a mismatch in matrix dimensions, the code throws an error. The solution is presented in `bugSolution.R`, highlighting the necessary correction to perform the multiplication correctly.
